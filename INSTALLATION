To install this program, run the setup.py script.

setup.py --bin <destination of upddate-repo.py> --mod <destination of repository
modules>

update-repo.py should be in a directory on your PATH environment variable,
and the repository modules (*_repository.py) need to be in a directory
where python will find them (update-repo.py's working directory,
python's library directories, or PYTHONPATH)

If you don't specify the bin or mod directories, setup will use
/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib respectively.
