To install this program, run the setup.py script.

setup.py --bin <location of upddate-repo.py> --mod <location of repository
modules>

update-repo.py should be in a directory on your PATH environment variable,
and the repository modules (*_repository.py) need to be in a directory
where python will find them (update-repo.py's working directory,
python's library directories, or PYTHONPATH)
